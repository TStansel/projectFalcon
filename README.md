Welcome to Public Playlist, code named Project Falcon!

We used Spotify API and AWS to make your social gathering unlike any other!
Our website opens to an ongoing playlist featuring the top ten tracks that the crowd has voted for.
If you go onto the mobile-friendly website, you can vote for one of the featured tracks or search and add your own.
What could be better than a DJ that always chooses the right songs?
